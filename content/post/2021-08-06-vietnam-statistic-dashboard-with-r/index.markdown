In this project, I built an small Shiny (an R framework to build web app) dashboard to visualize general statistic data of Vietnam. The source of data came from [Vietnam general statistics office](https://www.gso.gov.vn). 

The dashboard now hosted on [shinyapps.io](https://haivo.shinyapps.io/education-dashboard/) but it can be deploy on any others platform. You could browser my dashboard source code at this github [repo](https://github.com/vohai611/education-dashboard). The repository also had a Docker file to build the dashboard imagine.

This is the screenshot from the dashboard:
